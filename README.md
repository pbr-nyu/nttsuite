# NTTSuite

NTTSuite provides a platform to benchmark several popular NTT implementations in GPU, FPGA, and ASIC. Implementations are analyzed and profiled and the speedup is measured and compared. By analyzing the result, we optimize the pease alrogithm for FPGA and ASIC to improve speedup. In addiiton, optimized implementation is also benchmarked on GPU for different vector size and different vector element width.

## Content in this repo:

all 6 algorithms have implementations in CPU, GPU, FPGA and ASIC. Files are stored in folders which its name indicates the implementation method and algorithm name.

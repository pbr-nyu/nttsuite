# NTTSuite (Beta release)

NTTSuite provides a platform to benchmark several popular NTT implementations on the CPU and acceleration. Implementations are analyzed and profiled and the speedup is measured and compared. By analyzing the results, we optimize the pease alrogithm for FPGA and ASIC to improve speedup.

## Content in this repo:

7 algorithms have implementations for CPU and HLS. Files are stored in folders, names indicate the implementation method.
